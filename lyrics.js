  "We go fast with the game we play",
  "Who knows why it's gotta be this way?",
  "We say nothing more than we need",
  "I say your place when we leave",
  "Lighting strikes every time she moves",
  "And everybody's watching her but she's looking at you, oh, oh",
  "Hurry up now, I need a miracle",
  "Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter",
  "Please allow me to introduce myself"
